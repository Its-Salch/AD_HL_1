# Overview

This project simulates a small-scale enterprise IT environment using **Oracle VirtualBox**, **Windows Server 2025 (Insider Preview)**, and **Windows 10**.

The primary goal was to **build a fully functional Active Directory (AD) domain** to strengthen my practical skills in:
- Windows domain configuration
- Identity and access management
- DHCP and DNS configuration
- Domain-joining client machines
- Automating user creation with PowerShell

In this lab, I:
1. Configured a **Windows Server 2025** machine as a domain controller.
2. Installed and configured **DHCP** and **DNS** roles.
3. Joined a Windows 10 workstation to the domain.
4. Used **PowerShell scripting** to automate the creation of over **1,000 Active Directory users**.

This environment mirrors **real-world workflows** performed by System Administrators, IT Support Specialists, and SOC Analysts. It transformed my conceptual understanding into **hands-on experience**, reinforcing my knowledge in **Windows administration, networking, and automation**.
